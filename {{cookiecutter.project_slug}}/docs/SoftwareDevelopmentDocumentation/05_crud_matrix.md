# CRUD Matrix

A CRUD Matrix, also known as a Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD) Matrix, is a table used in software development to identify and document the operations that can be performed on data within a system. It provides a high-level view of the functionality of the system and helps to ensure that all necessary operations are accounted for in the design.

The matrix consists of four basic operations:

- Create (C): Refers to the ability to add new data to the system.
- Read (R): Refers to the ability to retrieve or view existing data in the system.
- Update (U): Refers to the ability to modify existing data in the system.
- Delete (D): Refers to the ability to remove data from the system.

Each row in the matrix represents a data item or an object, and each column represents a specific operation. The intersection of a row and a column represents the specific operation that can be performed on the data item.

The CRUD matrix is a useful tool in ensuring that all necessary operations are accounted for in the design of the system and in identifying potential issues early in the development process.
