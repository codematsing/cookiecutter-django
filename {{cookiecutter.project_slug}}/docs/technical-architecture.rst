Tech Stack
----------

A tech stack is the combination of technologies a company uses to build and run an application or project. Sometimes called a "solutions stack," a tech stack typically consists of programming languages, frameworks, a database, front-end tools, back-end tools, and applications connected via APIs.

Class Diagram
-------------

A Class Diagram represents the classes, objects, and their relationships in a system. It provides a blueprint of the classes and their attributes, operations, and relationships with other classes.

A class diagram consists of several elements, including:

- Classes: Represent the objects and entities in a system, and are represented as rectangles.
- Attributes: Represent the data or properties of a class, and are represented as a list of variables within the class rectangle.
- Operations: Represent the behavior or actions of a class, and are represented as a list of methods within the class rectangle.
- Relationships: Represent the relationships between classes, such as inheritance, aggregation, composition, and association. They are represented as arrows connecting classes.

Class diagrams are useful for understanding the structure of a system and for illustrating the relationships between classes.

Object Diagram
--------------

An Object Diagram represent a snapshot of a system at a specific point in time, showing the objects and their relationships in the system. It provides a detailed view of the structure and behavior of the system, focusing on the objects and their interactions.

An object diagram consists of several elements, including:

* Objects: Represent the instances of classes or components in a system, and are represented as rectangles.
* Attributes: Represent the data or properties of an object, and are represented as a list of variables within the object rectangle.
* Relationships: Represent the relationships between objects, such as associations, dependencies, or composition. They are represented as arrows connecting objects.
* Operations: Represent the behavior or actions of an object, and are represented as a list of methods within the object rectangle.

Object diagrams are useful for understanding the relationships between objects in a system and for debugging and troubleshooting. They can be used in a variety of domains, including software development, system design, and architecture.

Diving deeper, there are three main types of relationship  between classes or objects:

* Composition is a strong ownership relationship, where a class contains objects of another class.
* Extension is an inheritance relationship, where a derived class adds or modifies behavior from a base class. 
* Aggregation is a weak ownership relationship, where a class contains objects of another class that can exist independently.

In summary, the main differences between these three types of relationships are related to the degree of dependence and ownership between the classes. Composition implies strong ownership and dependence, extension implies inheritance and modification of behavior, and aggregation implies weak ownership and dependence.

Deployment Diagram
-------------------

A Deployment Diagram represent the physical deployment of software components and hardware components in a system. It provides a visual representation of the mapping of software components to hardware components, such as servers, databases, and clients.

A deployment diagram consists of several elements, including:

- Nodes: Represent the hardware components in a system, such as servers, clients, or databases.
- Components: Represent the software components in a system, such as modules, libraries, or executables.
- Communication Paths: Represent the communication between nodes, such as network connections or communication protocols.
- Artifacts: Represent the physical files that are generated or deployed as part of the system, such as executables or configuration files.

Deployment diagrams are useful for understanding the physical deployment of software components and hardware components in a system. They can be used in a variety of domains, including software development, system design, and architecture.
