the following guidelines are followed:

Git Branches

Project version control must follow this structure with 4 main branches:

    * dev - merging point for all feature implementation and bug fixes prior to UAT / beta testing
    * UAT - User Acceptance Testing or beta testing release
    * hotfix - hot fixes for production release
    * master - production release
